# Electrotherapy Emulator

To assist in the delivery of the electrotherapy practical exam for all students at London Metropolitan following the move to online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic, I created a site that emulates the menu options of the electrotherapy machines in the sports therapy clinic.

This allowed students, using screenshare with examiners, to demonstrate their skills in appropriate modality selection for delivery of electrotherapy treatments.
